 * Internally, all work is placed in the file global runq_tab.

 * in global runq_event, which indexes entries in global runq_tab.
 *
 * runq_schedw() schedules specific jobs that are referred to it, and is
 * called by runq_dispatch() and runq_add().
 * runq_dispatch() is called by the SIGALRM and traverses the event queue
 * to start the the peices of work.
 *
 * For efficiency, repeated work execution is gathered together in `runs', 
 * detected by runq_schedw() and called by runq_dispatch(). These are
 * generally calls to open and shut I/O for efficiency.
 * Sometimes, the final execution in a run takes a while to complete, so 
 * a dummy run is scheduled for a further interval but the work structure 
 * is flagged as expired. This procedure will repeat untill the job has 
 * completed.
 *
 * If the clearup flag is set in the runq_work structure, the entry will
