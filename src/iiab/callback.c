/*
 * Callback class.
 *
 * A generic software event system, that maintains a one to many relationship
 * between software events and interested callback functions.
 *
 * An event is registered using a string as an identifier. Intrested parties
 * that would like to know when the event occurs register callback functions
 * against the event identifier. The event is raised by the emitter, 
 * control passes to the callback, which traverses the callback list.
 * when the list is exhausted, control passes to the emitter.
 *
 * Arguments are simple and must be agreed between the parites. It is
 * just a set of four (void *) with no memory management.
 * Callback functions are called in the order they were registered.
 * Events can be removed, in which case associated callbacks are removed.
