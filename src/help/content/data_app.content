send data to application
%body%
This pop-up form will send the current data set to another application 
so that it can be further processed or visualised.
The current data set is either displayed in a table or drawn as a graph
and it doesn't matter if you have zoomed-in, moved about, selected
specific curves or instances -- everything in the time period is sent!
<p>
A temporary file is created for the duration of the application run and will
be removed when it comes to an end. Therefore, the results should be saved 
to a file by the users before the end.

    A row of names will be output as the fist line, with each name
    corresponding to the columns below it.

<tr>
  <td valign=top><b>column information</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
    Several information rows will be placed after the column names and
    before the data rows. Each row represents a peice of information that
    <b>habitat</b> holds on each column, such as a description.
    <p>
    Information is printed in column order and an <u>additional</u> 
    unlabeled column is printed at the end to name the information row.
    This is unusual as it 'throws' some scanners that require all rows
    to have constant columns.
    Additionally, a single line containing two dashes, `--', is
    inserted before the data lines as a delimiter.

    In the above example, we see an info line called <b>alternate</b>
    giving more information about each column.

<tr>
  <td valign=top><b>insertion time</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
    An additional column will be placed in the output, named <b>inserted</b>
    that contains the time of the sample, generally the insertion time.
    The format is <b>time_t</b> in C-speak, which is the number of 
    seconds since the unix epoch, Janurary 1 1970.

<tr>
  <td valign=top><b>sequence number</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
    An additional column will be placed in the output, named <b>sequence</b>
    that contains an internally generated sequence number, running from 0
    positively and wrapping at 2<sup>31</sup>.
    <p>
    It is useful for two reasons: Firstly it determins the order of data
    when multiple samples arrive at the datastore during the same second.
    Secondly, it groups multi line samples together, unseful in 
    processing the same attributes from multiple instances like disk 
    statistics.
    <pre>
inserted   sequence  read/s  write/s  disk
998337060  0         1       2        1
998337060  0         4       5        2
998337060  1         7       8        1
998337060  1         10      11       2
    </pre>
    The table above shows two samples over four rows. As the 
    <b>inserted</b> time column is the same, only the two values from 
    <b>sequence</b> tells us there are two sets of samples. 
    In this case <b>disk</b> changes and will be the instance.
