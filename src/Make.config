# This file contains platform specific configurations
# (it can be thought of as a simple replacement for GNU autoconf)
# The systems supported are detected automatically in this file, which
# contains a fragment of GNU Make. Once detected, the platform settings
# are made for things like the locations of Gtk+, curl, etc.
# If the settings that I use do not correspond with yours, use the 
# EXTRA_ variables below to add more locations for your system.

# The external packages needed are: Gtk+, glib, gdk, Curl, readline, GDBM
# 
# EXTRA_INCLUDE - Includes should be in the form of switches, of the form 
#                 -I <dir>
# EXTRA_LIB - The library definitions should be of the form -l<lib>
# EXTRA_LIBDIR - Library locations should just be dirs, which are appended
#                to GNU Make's VPATH. The dirs in this path are then 
#                searched to find the libraries in EXTRA_LIB.
