statclock
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
Reports on the running public instance of clockwork on the local machine.

This shell script locates the lock file for clockwork, which is the 
collection agent for the Habitat suite.
It prints the process id, owning user, controlling terminal and start time 
of the daemon if it is found in the process table. If not found, then the
lock file is removed if it is there and a message to that effect is
printed

Private instances of clockwork (started with \-j option) can not be stopped 
by this method, as they do not register in a lock file.
Instead, they should be controlled by conventional process control methods.
