# Script to edit a route object and save it back to the same location.
# The user's favorite editor will be used, although the data will generally
# tabular in structure which should be preserved.
#
# If there is one argument containing a colon, it is assumed that
# it is a route address.
# If there are multiple arguments, then it is assumed that the first is 
# a file name and the second a ring and the third a duration.
# The editor is obtained by firstly looking at environment variable VISUAL,
# followed by EDITOR and finally using the default editor `vi'.
